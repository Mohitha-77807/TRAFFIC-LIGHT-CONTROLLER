# TRAFFIC-LIGHT-CONTROLLER
 This project presents the design and implementation of an intelligent traffic light  controller aimed at optimizing traffic flow and reducing congestion in urban areas. The  proposed system employs a combination of sensors, timers, and microcontrollers to  dynamically adjust traffic light durations based on real-time traffic density.
